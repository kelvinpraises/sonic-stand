## 🌟 Overview

SonicStand reimagines decentralized curation through an Agentic DePIN network powered by VISE (Video Indexing & Sequencing Engine). Our solution achieves three core objectives:

1. **Narrative Balance**: Bridges traditional crypto values with modern agentic AI trends
2. **Onchain Participation**: Enables HTML5-capable devices to join a decentralized compute network
3. **Token Utility Proof**: Demonstrates real-world value for agent tokens through verifiable video insights

Built for the Sonic DeFAI Hackathon, SonicStand transforms video content into immutable, explorable knowledge graphs while maintaining computational inclusivity through our HTML5-first approach.

## ✨ Features
